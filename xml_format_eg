 <field name="question">    What is the industry standard height for a showe
rhead?
 </field>
 <field name="answer">
    Typically the connection for the shower arm is stubbed out at about 78” 
above the floor with the shower head at about 74”. NKBA however, recommends the 
showerhead be placed so the tallest user can easily wash their hair while standi
ng under the shower spray. Therefore, the height of 74” may be too low for many 
people. The best solution is a shower head mounted on a sliding vertical bar. If
you do raise the showerhead we suggest the waterproof wall material within the 
shower extend at least 3 inches above the final or highest possible position for
the showerhead.</field>
